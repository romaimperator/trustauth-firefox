		Release 1.1.0
		* The add-on now has a new icon!
		* The add-on should load the Forge library properly.
		* The Forge library has been updated to the latest version.
		* Adding a new icon for the add-on.
		* The button is now grayed out when it is locked.
		* The button returns to normal when the add-on is unlocked.
		* The button is now correctly added to the toolbar after install.
		* The add-on will now automatically relock after being idle for a
		configurable timeout.
		* The minimum version number has been bumped to 4.0 because of the inline
		options page.
		* The inline options page has been cleaned up leaving only important
		settings and clearly showing which options are advanced.
		* The user can now choose a key length from a fixed list of key lengths.
		* The user can now change her master password after the add-on asks for
		the current password.
		* The add-on will now show a green border and the add-on icon around the
		login form after a successful preparation.
		* The add-on will change the border to red and provide a tooltip on hover
		over the login form indicating what the error is.
		* The add-on will alert the user if the server's timeout has passed so the
		user knows to refresh the page.
		* The add-on now honors the Add TrustAuth Key button. More specifically,
		if the page contains the button, the key is ONLY inserted when the button
		is pressed. If there is no button and the page contains a login form with
		TrustAuth fields then the key is still automatically inserted.
		* The user can now export and import a copy of the encrypted database. The
		user is prompted for a name for the exported database and the extension
		'.tdb' is appended if not already there. The user can import an existing
		database but only after being notified that importing a database will
		overwrite the existing database. This notification can be turned off. The
		user can only import a database if the add-on is unlocked to prevent
		someone's database being overwritten by someone else using his computer.
		* If a database doesn't exist for the add-on, the user is now prompted
		when they try to unlock whether she would like to import an existing
		database (no password required) or to create the default database.
		* A bug was fixed which would allow multiple replenishment activities to
		run at once.
		* A bug was fixed which caused the random encryption key that is generated
		to be a byte string. Now it is correctly converted to a hex string.

		Release 1.0.2
		* Moved the check to generate an encryption key.
		* Added the hard-coded key pair for the demo site.

		Release 1.0.1
		* Fixed a couple bugs with creating the database and replenishing the
		cachhe of keys.

		Release 1.0.0
		* where to start...
		* Updated the add-on to use the new TrustAuth architecture. This included
		the processing of TrustAuth challenges provided on a login form. This data
		is a special format using the TrustAuth Protocol which includes among
		other things a timestamp of expiration, a domain name, and a hash of the
		message. The response is also placed into a field using the protocol
		format.
		* The addon now has database migrations. This will allow me to change the
		schema without needing to do many checks to figure out what version the
		database is on and how to get to the latest version.
		* The security has been improved. The password is now passed through a
		password-based key derivation function with 2048 iterations to generate an
		encryption key. Then instead of using this key directly, it is used to
		encrypt a randomly generated encryption key. This random key is what is
		actually used to encrypt all of the key pairs. This makes it easy to
		change the password without requiring reencryption of every key pair.
		Lastly, instead of using hard-coded salts, the salts required are
		generated randomly the first time they are needed.
